# F1-Race-Predictor
## The purpose of this project is to build an algorithm to predict the winner in all 21 races of Formula 1 in season 2019.

### Data Collection

Files : API_races, qualifying, weather

For my data mining I used two sources: the Ergast F1 data repository and the official Formula 1 website, which contain information about all the championships and races from 1950 to 2019. Eventually I combined all the data about races, results, drivers and constructors standing positions, qualifications and weather into a single dataframe.
